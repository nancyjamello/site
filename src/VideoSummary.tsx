              Join me for a relaxing and rejuvenating hatha yoga class, where we
              will practice breathing techniques and yoga poses to balance our
              body and mind. Hatha yoga is a type of yoga that combines physical
              postures and breathwork to channel vital energy. In this class, we
              will move through a series of asanas at a slow pace, focusing on
              proper alignment and awareness. Whether you are new to yoga or a
              seasoned practitioner, this class will help you feel calm, strong,
              and flexible. Namaste!
